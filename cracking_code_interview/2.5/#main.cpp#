  Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at
  the beginning of the loop
  -- DEFINITION --
  Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a nodeœôòùs next pointer
  points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list
  -- EXAMPLE --
  input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
  output: C
